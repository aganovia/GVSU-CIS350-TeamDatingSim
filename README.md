## Prerequisites

If running the game through the RenPy launcher, the RenPy SDK will need to be installed. More instructions on that under "Run Instructions" below.

## Run Instructions
There are two ways to run the game: 1) using a PC/Mac build executable, or 2) through the RenPy Launcher.

1. Follow [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1az7ftY8EJRIvNACc6j2xvsX73XWzscc9?usp=sharing) to a Google Drive folder containing zip files of PC and Mac builds of the game. Download the appropriate build for your OS, extract the files, and run the "DatingSim.exe" file.

2. First go to [Renpy Download](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html) and install RenPy on your computer. Next, clone this repository. After the repository has been cloned, open the RenPy SDK folder that you downloaded. From there, click the "renpy.exe" file to launch the RenPy Launcher. In the launcher, click the "Preferences" button in the lower right.. Once there, click "Projects Directory" and set the path to the "src" directory from this repo. The path should look something like this: "reviousfolders\GVSU-CIS350-TeamDatingSim\src". Click okay, push continue, and return. The game should then be listed under Projects; if not, click the refresh button. If it still doesn't appear, check the preferences to make sure the Projects Directory is properly set. Finally click on the game and click "Launch Project". The game will load up in a separate window.
